            <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon quick-rise yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>6 (4 inch) cheese strings</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1-1/2 cups shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded asiago cheese (optional)</li>
            <li>24 slices dry pepperoni</li>
            <li>Garlic seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In large bowl, combine water, sugar and yeast; let stand until foamy, 
                about 10 minutes. Add oil, salt. Add flour; mix to form ball. 
                Transfer to clean surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about six to eight minutes. 
                Return to bowl; cover and place in warm place for one hour.</li>
            <li>Add remaining oil to 12 inch cast-iron (or other oven safe) skillet, coating bottom and side. 
                Stretch dough into circle and place into pan. Cover and rest for 30 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 475F.</li>
            <li>Using fingertips, press dough outward to edge of pan. Place cheese strings in single 
                row around edge of dough; flip one inch rim overtop, sealing cheese into crust. 
                Spread sauce onto dough, sprinkle with cheese and place pepperoni on top. Sprinkle garlic 
                seasoning onto edge crust.</li>
            <li>Bake until crust is golden brown, about 20-25 minutes. 
                Rest for five minutes, slice and serve. </li>
