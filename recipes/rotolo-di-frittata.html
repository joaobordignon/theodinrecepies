        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45 ml) milk</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 ounce (28 g) Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>3 ounces (85 g) prosciutto cotto, sliced thin</li>
            <li>4 ounces (113 g) sliced provolone cheese, sliced thin</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PESTO</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (240 ml) arugula (tightly packed), washed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) pine nuts</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45 ml) extra virgin olive oil, more as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) grated pecorino, more as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 F (175 C).</li>
            <li>Combine the eggs, milk, salt, pepper, Parmesan, and lemon juice together 
                in a bowl and mix until uniform in texture.  
                Prepare a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper overlapping the sides.   
                Spray the parchment with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture in an even layer into the lined pan to make a wide, thin, 
                flat omelette.</li>
            <li>Bake the eggs for about eight to ten minutes or until firm.  
                After cooking, cover and reserve for the roll.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>ARUGULA PESTO</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small food processor, combine the arugula, pine nuts, pecorino, lemon juice, 
                and olive oil, season with salt and pepper and blend to a paste.  
                Add more pecorino or oil if needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>ROLL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Transfer the cooked egg to a work surface on the parchment paper. </li>
            <li>While still hot, layer first with the provolone, then add the sliced prosciutto, then the pesto.  
                Roll up the cooked egg around the fillings to create a tight pinwheel roll, using the parchment 
                to shape the roll into a large log.  Wrap it tightly and refrigerate for at least an hour for it 
                to firm up.</li>
            <li>When serving, bring the roll to room temperature before slicing.  
                Serve at room temperature or warm the slices gently in an oven before serving. </li>
        </ol>
